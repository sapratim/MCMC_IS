Code for "MCMC Importance Sampling via Moreau-Yosida Envelopes" paper by Apratim Shukla, Dootika Vats, and Eric Chi

ALL the examples have a .R functions file, a .R run file and a .R output file.

Specifically, the NuclearNorm and the Poisson examples do not have .Rdata files generated by the run files uploaded here owing to the size of the files. The same can be generated using the run files in both these examples. The .Rdata files for the Trendfiltering example are added. Additionally, the .Rout files for all the examples have been provided here as well.

In all the examples, a Px adapted version for Barkers algorithm have been coded and the output obtained. However, the same is NOT used owing to a lack of theoretical results in the literature.

All the plots can be seen in the plots subfolder in the respective examples' folders. These can be recreated using the output files in the examples.
